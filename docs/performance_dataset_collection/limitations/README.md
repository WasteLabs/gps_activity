# Requirements & Limitations for preformance dataset üìê

* Route plan data **must** contain following detail:
  * date when vehicle must to conduct collection
  * vehicle unique identified assigned to service collection

* Route plan data **should** contain following detail:
  * `lat,lon` coordinates to pick up garbage from

* Overlap limitations
  * `dates` between gps & route plan **must't** exceed lag for more than 2 days: higher values leads to lower confidence that match is true (False positive risk)
  * `vehicle ids` between gps & route plan **must** overlap with each other, other wise we will generate many FP true clusters in train dataset
