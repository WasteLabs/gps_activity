# GPS Activity 🚚 🚛 📍

Waste Labs internal module created for analysis of waste vehicle activities. Given module is created for high mobility and quick deployment of gps analytical reports, dashboards and so on.

## Submodules navigation

* 📍 **[Extraction module](./extraction/README.md)**: Module for clustering GPS data & extraction type of activity
* 📊 **[Metrics module](./extraction/README.md)**: Module for extraction of metrics from clustered GPS

## Design intuition 📖

User should provide only input pivot columns and data itself, everything else must remain as it is in favor of compatability between submodules and idempotancy of execution
